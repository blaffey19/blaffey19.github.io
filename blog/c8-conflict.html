  <h1>The Largest Conflict of my Life</h1>
  <h2>How it felt to lose my mom, and how I deal with it 2 years later</h2>
  <h4>May 10th, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    I have decided to write this blog post about a very serious and personal conflict that changed my life forever. Please understand that as I write this, I am not fishing for sympathy. I am going to try and project my true feelings about this as accurately and honestly as possible.

    I suppose the true conflict here is really a personal one, one that forces some of my thoughts and feelings against other thoughts and feelings in an emotional tug-of-war. In November of 2012, I was rocked to my inner core, and my life was changed forever by a monumentally devastating event. I lost my mother, very suddenly and very unexpectedly, to an out of nowhere heart attack. I was only 19 years old, my younger brother and only sibling, just 15 years old. We both grew up being primarily raised by our mom, as our father was semi involved, but we really only spent time with him on weekends, or more commonly every other. So, you can probably imagine the horrible void that this left in both of our lives. A huge part of me was taken with my mother's life, and my brother, being so young and fragile still, was even more damaged by this tremendous loss. It is very hard to put into words the feelings that I first had, but strangely, it was very surreal and bizarre-almost dreamlike. I felt as if I were living in a strange, horrible dream, for days and days, and that it was extremely improbable-impossible, even-that something so terrible and crushing could even happen to me. I pretended for days that my mother wasn't really gone, that I would wait and expect her to walk through the front door from work, a beaming smile on her face, like always. Alas, that moment never came. And, deep down, I knew that it never would, but something in my brain, something was veiling this horrible truth from me, or trying to. I was in complete and utter denial, and this was the first feeling I had when I lost my mom, if you can believe that. Not grief, not horror, not depression, but just denial. I was in complete shock, and just tried to ignore my real emotions that were buried somewhere deep in my mind, covered up with piles and piles of disbelief and false hope. It wasn't until, perhaps four days after she passed away, that I had casually made my way into her bedroom, and just collapsed right there. I was suddenly reduced to a sobbing heap on her bed, cursing life and pleading and begging to some unknown force to bring my mother back. It's all I wanted, it's all I had thought about. My surreal layers of denial had finally cracked open, my true feelings of anguish, grief, and anger pluming out of them. I was angry with the world, angry at everyone around me, and most of all, I was angry at myself. I thought that it was all my fault that my mom had passed away so suddenly and shockingly. I don't even know why I felt this way, but it really began to crush me under the immense pressure I was feeling. I felt this way for a couple of weeks, I suppose. That's when the sadness phased it's way in. Mind you, my mother was a revered and beloved woman in our community-cherished, for sure. The family help and community support we had received was absolutely beautiful and more than plentiful, and it lasted for weeks. It's when everyone has to go back to their regular 9-5 lives, and stops coming by daily to check in on you, that you really start to feel the sorrow. I was sad for a long time, with no more real distractions to help me forget about my tragedy. It was then, that I realized, that these feelings inside of me would fight and push and pull at eachother, and I could never decide which feeling was the "right" way to feel. To try and resolve this personal conflict inside me, I began talking. Talking to my friends, my family, anyone that would be kind enough to lend a caring ear to me for a little while. They always say better out than in, and I cannot think of a better analogy for my situation at hand. It felt great to express my thoughts to someone else, to have someone that would listen to how I feel. I found, and still feel to this day, that expressing your thoughts and feelings to someone, anyone, is much better than allowing the feelings to stew and fester inside your own mind, tearing at your emotions.</p>

      It felt great to write this post, because I have never really done something like this where I can just project all of my thoughts on how I try to resolve this ever going conflict in my life. The fact that I no longer have a mother will never fade from me, but the fact that I have figured out how to deal with the conflict of my emotions towards it is a huge goal that I thought I would never achieve.</p>
