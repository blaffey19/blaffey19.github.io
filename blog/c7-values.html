  <h1>Reflecting on My Values</h1>
  <h2></h2>
  <h4>May 3rd, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    I think that this is a great topic to write a blog post on. I don't often stop to try and think of the values that I like about myself as a person, and this was a great way to do that. I chose three true core values that I believe in very strongly: will-power, growth, and ambition. I consider myself to be a very forward thinking person, and I try to accomplish all of the goals that I set for myself. I have a very strong will of determination, and I try my best and always try to finish out strong and not quit. I think that these three values encompass all of that. In terms of how much I agree that I try to live up to these values, on a 1-5 scale, I would rate them as this: will-power: 5. I am very determined and goal oriented, and I keep this in mind everyday. Growth: 4. I strive to learn and grow as a person everyday, but sometimes I can get distracted by thinking about the big picture and the final accomplishment, and lose sight of growing intellectually and emotionally sometimes. Ambition: 5. I am very ambitious in my everyday life, and I think that this plays hand in hand with will-power, you cannot have one without the other. The one value that I should focus on here is will-power. Strength of will is always something that I have put a major emphasis on in my life. I have had a few times where I came to be very overweight, and I decided to change that.
    I worked out, dieted, and stayed determined on getting to a healthy and normal weight, and I never once thought about giving up. I eventually achieved my goal, and it felt absolutely amazing. I still think about that as motivation. I also think that, given that I believe my stereotype is a kid with no college degree, people would think I'm not as smart or well rounded as them. I am trying to defy those beliefs by coming to DBC, and I think that alone says alot about my will-power and determination, to take a big risk like this, fully knowing that I dont have the traditional education most of my dbc classmates will have, and still going through with this. With my will-power and ambition, and willingness to learn and grow, I believe that I can conquer DBC, and my possible stereotype threat, just by being so strong willed and determined. I think that my hunger to succeed is what will truly allow me to accel in this program, and I cannot wait to prove it!</section>
