  <h2>What does Dev Bootcamp Really Mean to Me?</h2>
  <h4>March 22nd, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p> After watching Shereef's enlightening Fireside Chat video, the true meaning and purpose of DBC has finally fully dawned on me; Dev Bootcamp isn't just about learning how to become a really good programmer, it's ultimately about learning how to become a better human being. I think that the DBC experience is about learning. Period. Just learning. Not just coding, or meeting new people and teachers, but learning new ways to purposefully interact with other people. It's about learning from other people, and learning from what you can teach other people. You are supposed to learn from eachother, not just the curriculum, not just from the teacher or the lesson. I believe that the best learning happens when you are working with a partner, hit a brick wall in the assignment together, and figure out the solution as a team. I completely agree that admitting not knowing how to do something or not knowing the answer to a question or problem is the best way to learn. When you can't figure something out, you should be compelled to figure it out. Simple, I know, but I think that that is truly how you become a great programmer, and, better yet, a great learner in general. I am understanding now that this is what Dev Bootcamp really wants from me. It is completely okay to not know. Nobody at DBC is going to belittle me or be condescending towards me for not knowing something. As a cohort, we are all in it together. No matter how much experience someone may have over someone else, we are all here for the same reason, and we should all help eachother get to that finish line as a team, not as a competition amongst eachother. All this being said, what really resonated with me was the "Kitchen" analogy. Yes, there may be people with the consumer mindset, that want to walk in to DBC as if it were a restaurant, where they see on the menu "9 weeks to a great web programming career-$12,000" and say great! I'll take that. However, I believe that most or all of the people coming to DBC are in the "Kitchen", not the dining room. I can say right now as a definite that I am a chef in the kitchen. I want to be hands on. I don't just want to come to DBC, sit there, pretend that I'm learning, coast through everything, and at that point if I still miraculously made it through to graduation, sit and wait for some great job to fall in my lap. I want to LEARN. I want to get my hands dirty, my brain full of new knowledge, and be able to tell myself I did a job well done. I have a one track mind in the sense that when I want to do something, or I want something, I will do whatever it takes to get there. I want to push myself to learn everything I possibly can. I am prepared to make mistakes and not know things. But I want to learn from my mistakes, I want to take the idea of not knowing something, and figure out the answer to it. I am ready to learn how to learn. I am ready to take the DBC challenge head on, and not stop if I hit a speedbump or a wall. I want to succeed, and I truly believe that Dev Bootcamp is what will get me there. Bring it on, DBC!
