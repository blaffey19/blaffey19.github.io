  <h1>So, we know about Ruby. Now, what the heck is Rails?!</h1>
  <h2>A (sort of) in-depth look at Ruby's close buddy, Rails</h2>
  <h4>May 10th, 2015</h4>

  <p>
    Okay so, I wasn't really aware of this, but apparently Rails is WHY Ruby is as popular as it is today. Given that I am here typing this very blog post today because of my decision to learn Ruby and thus join DBC, I thought that Rails would be a fantastic topic to cover here. So, what in the world is Rails? Is it it's own programming language? Is it just an extension of Ruby? I decided to find out.
  </p>

  <p>
    After some research, I found that the answers to the above questions are yes, sort of, and no, sort of. The proper term is actually Ruby on Rails, or RoR. Most people just decide to call it Rails. Works for me.
  </p>

  <p>
    So, if it's called Ruby ON Rails, it must be related to Ruby. This is true. Rails is sort of an extension of the Ruby programming language, in the form of a software library. I like to think of it all in this analogy: If Ruby is English language, then Rails is just Ruby with a sweet Southern accent. Or a haaad New England drawl. Or a country Texas slur. You should get the idea by now. Rails pretty much comes into play whenever you are applying Ruby to make a web based application with it. It's not that simple though, as Rails blends Ruby, HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript altogether, in order to make complex websites. Rails is the website's 'framework', which I imagine is why it's called Ruby 'On' Rails, because you are literally building a website with Ruby ON a Rails framework. So there's that.
  </p>

  <p>
    The creator of Rails, a Mr. David Hansson(Mandatory Mmmbop reference-you would do it too, if you were typing this, admit it)said that he chose Ruby as the premier language to base Rails on for the same reasons that everyone else loves it for: it's incredibly easy to write, very interpretive, and allows for writing good old 'DRY' code (Don't Repeat Yourself, for those of you that are not programming inclined). Rails was made possible thanks to the RubyGems feature of Ruby, which manages all of the Ruby libraries(Gems), and allows for easy and universal access to all of the libraries that are available to be downloaded into your Ruby app on your computer. Rails is just a big, big Ruby library.
  </p>

  <p>
    Based on my hour of researching Rails, here is the clearest description that I have come up with, from an operative point of view: HTML and CSS make up the aesthetic parts of a website, the fonts, colors, margins, borders, pretty much anything that is visual. JavaScript is the language that 'manipulates' the HTML and CSS parts of the website, and is really what interacts with the user, like the tabs, windows, and such. Ruby, then, packages all of these different files, and allows them to function. Ruby is certainly not the only language to do this, theres plenty others, like Python, Java, or C++, per se. What Rails does, then, is package all of these files written with HTML, CSS, and Js, and uses Ruby as a sort of vehicle to apply them to making websites or web apps. I know this wasn't the most in-depth and knowledgable post on Rails, but I hope I taught you as much as I taught myself in a relatively small amount of time of research.</p>
