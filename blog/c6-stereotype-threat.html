  <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
  <h4>April 26th, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    There's really no way around this, stereotype threat is a very ugly, very sad concept. Admittingly, I cannot really say that I have ever suffered stereotype threat. I can however say that to a certain extent, I suppose that I feel sort of like the minority in DBC. The reason: I do not have a college degree, and I am nearly sure that that puts me in a minority in my cohort. This does intimidate me, I cannot lie. I catch myself often in these thoughts as I go through my weekly challenges: "Am I even as smart as the rest of these students?" "Most of them have college degrees and some career in the tech field already..so what does that make me?" "I'm very young and undereducated for this, will I survive through it?" I hate to admit that, but I do get these feelings constantly, and I try my best to not let it affect my work and studies in phase 0, but it honestly does. Now I know that this isn't the proper definition of stereotype threat, but I do feel like an outsider in this DBC world, and I try my best to fight that feeling off. So in this respect, I can totally sympathize and understand what other people may be feeling if they are suffering from sterotype threat. I want to let these people know: you are not alone. Even if you do not wish to admit it or acknowledge it, trust me, there are other people that feel the same way that you do. It is crucial though, that you fight the feeling of stereotype threat and social intimidation. If you really want something badly enough, you can get through it. It is not an easy thing to simply overcome, I am sure. Stereotype threat is a terrible psychological bugaboo that stays in the back of your mind all of the time. I really enjoy getting support from other people, even if they do not suffer from stereotype threat, it is really good of them to reach out to someone that is, and reassure them.
