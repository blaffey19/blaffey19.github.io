  <h1>Any Questions?</h1>
  <h2>A Few Good Tips on How to Get the Most Out of Your Questions</h2>
  <h4>May 17th, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>For this week's cultural blog post, we were asked to do some quick research on what makes a good question, and how to get the ideal answer out of it. Here is what I found:</p>

    <p>First and foremost, you should really try to think about what you want the answer to, exactly. Now I know this sounds very obvious, but really, think about it...you should have a very precise, purposeful question that will immediately tell whomever you are asking exactly what you want to know. Make it as accurate and transparent of a question as possible-and that's not to say that you should have a short, cut off question. If your question is kind of lengthy, by all means, ask the entire question. Just make it precise, simple, and purposeful so that whoever is answering you has an exact idea of what you need them to tell you. This goes for verbal questions and questions that you would post online, such as stack overflow, yahoo answers, etc.</p>

    <p>Speaking of online questions, if you don't have a clear, simple title for your question, nobody is going to want to answer it. Trust me. Make your post title as short and precise as possible-"Cut to the chase", as they say.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, if you are posting a coding question, DON'T just copy and paste your entire program that has the coding problem you're trying to figure out included in it-just copy and paste enough of the program, or just the part that is giving you the problem-so that you don't tick off the people that are trying to help you and making them read lines and lines and lines(and lines and lines and lines) of extra code that has nothing to do with your actual problem. This will only confuse the people trying to answer your question, which will in turn, confuse you.</p>

    <p>The last little piece of advice that I have found, and I think what may be the most important, is this. When you are done writing your question/post, stop and proofread it. But, don't just proofread it from a grammatical perspective. Try to think about it like this: "Would I want to answer this question? Is this question clear and understandable? Is this question fairly simple to reply to with an answer that would make sense to the asker?" If you feel that you don't want to answer your own question, or that it doesn't make sense to you as you read it, then the chances are terribly high that no one else will want to answer your question, either. Make whatever changes to your question that you feel you should, until it makes sense to you as someone that is just reading it, and not asking it.</p>
