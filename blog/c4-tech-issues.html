  <h1>Encryption: A Double-Edged Sword</h1>
  <h2>Does Encrypted Data Protect Us or Hurt Us?</h2>
  <h4>April 12th, 2015</h4>

  I know that cybersecurity is probably the most discussed issue the tech world faces these days, with the Sony hack happening this past year, as well as various European websites being compromised by the radical Islamic terror group, Isis. There is one very intriguing subissue here, and that is this: What data should and shouldn't be encrypted, and who should have access to said encrypted data? After reading a very interesting and thought-provoking article on the Washington Post, I decided to discuss this major issue. Encryption is sort of like hiding digital data behind a veil, or a locked door, in order to protect the data, as well as the privacy of the user that created it. The major issues are that there are really no total regulations on what data is allowed to be or not be encrypted, and there are also laws in place that protect encrypted data, to a certain degree. This past September, Apple announced that on their newest software, all data would be encrypted, and that only the user would have the 'key' to access the encryptions. This may be great for the users themselves, seen as a very solid and secure form of privacy and personal information and data security. However, it poses many problems to the government and it's law enforcement agencies, and that is this: How can criminal and terrorist information and data be acquired if it is encrypted in such a manner? The nasty truth? It can't be. At least for now. The US government and National Security Agency is feverishly working and debating over how to find solutions to this very real and terrifying problem. There are currently proposals and ideas to create a mirror account of the encrypted data, so that as it is created and logged, it can be accessed by law enforcement and government agencies, if needed for criminal investigation, prosecutions, etc. This, however, seems bleak as a solution, because it is not believed that the tech companies would agree to such a term. I think that the bottom line here is, what should we prioritize more, our complete privacy in our personal lives and interactions, or the overall security and well being of our nation through technological security and strict encryption access protocols? I believe that one possible solution here is to make an agreement with major social network and tech companies, like Apple and Twitter, to rewire their software and encryption systems so that, only in a criminal case, allow full access to encrypted data of the particular person(s) under investigation, or any person(s) believed to be in affiliation with them. This would probably take many months or even years to come to fruition, given that the titan companies of the tech industry would agree to such bold terms with the US government. In my opinion, I am all for total personal privacy and security, especially in an ever evolving world that we live in, technologically speaking. However, I believe that we must put our well being and national security above all else, and get whatever laws passed that need to be passed in order to achieve this.
