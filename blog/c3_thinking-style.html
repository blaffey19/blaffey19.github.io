  <h1>My Learning Style</h1>
  <h2>The Thoughts of an Abstract Random Learner</h2>
  <h4>April 5th, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    When I found out that I was an abstract random learner, I wasn't really sure what it meant. I wondered, "Does this make me an eccentric weirdo? Am I really strange for being an abstract random?" The answer? No, not at all. (Okay, maybe I am a little quirky, but who isn't) After doing some research on the subject, I found it amazing to read all of the traits of an AR learner. Most of them define me perfectly. AR learners are more social, more communicative, more imaginative. The face value of something may not be it's true or full value. There could be something else at work in the formula that you can't see or can't quite understand. This is how I think. I prefer to learn with a group of people, and work on problems together. When I study, I tend to not make a strict list of things I have to learn or remember, I just try to learn as much as I can. I learn through visual demonstrations and explanations very well. I like to learn while being hands-on. I also like having a loose set of directions or instructions, and usually interpret them how I feel is necessary. I'm not afraid to 'color outside the lines', so to speak. I feel that I can use all of these attributes in a very positive way at DBC. After all, most of the learning we do is with a partner, or in a group, or from watching someone else explain something or demonstrate it. I believe that this is my optimum learning environment, so I am very excited about this. I believe that programming is also a sort of interpretive art as well. You can write the same functioning block of code tons of different ways, and there is no true wrong way of writing it, so long as it functions as you wanted it to. This is also very good for me, as I tend to improvise when given directions, and seek out a more unique strategy to the solution. I think that the biggest struggle for me at DBC thus far traces back to the fact that we are in our remote phase. I'm not saying that the work has been impossible or undoable to this point, but I learn much better when I am hands on, with another student or group of them, in front of someone demonstrating the subject, not on my computer, miles and miles away from the next closest Dragonfly(our cohort name, if you were wondering). I have learned an incredible amount of content in these first three weeks of phase 0, but I think I may have learned them quicker had we been on site and together for all of it. To try to alleviate this, I think that I am just going to give myself some extra time for each challenge, to better grasp the concept at hand, and to delve into the content a little more. I am learning so much during phase 0. With my abstract random learning style, though, I can only imagine how much I will learn on site. I am very, very excited.
