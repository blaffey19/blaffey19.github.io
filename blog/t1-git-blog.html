  <h1>An Intro to Git and GitHub</h1>
  <h2>Git, GitHub, and the Beauty of Version Control</h2>
  <h4>March 22nd, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>Version control is, to put it simply, like making a checkpoint in a video game, except you're doing it on your computer with code. Version control allows you to save your original file or program, then make whatever changes you want to it, and save it again with the new changes. The true beauty of "vc", though, is that it allows you to go back to the previous "checkpoints" you saved, so you can go back to the file before you made the current changes to it, and the changes before that, and before that, and before...I think you get my drift.

    </p>
    <p>Git is what you use inside your terminal to edit and create files through code, and git allows other people to open the same files and work on them with you. Git keeps track of any changes made in the files with three states: modified, staged, and committed. Whenever you make or add a change to a file in your git, you can check that it was changed by using 'git status' in whatever directory you keep git in in your terminal. If there any changes to any of the files in git, it will return it to you by saying 'modified: FILENAME'. It will also tell you how to move this modified file to the next state, which is being staged. To stage the file to be committed, you now use 'git add FILENAME'. To make sure that the file has been staged, enter 'git status' again. (You do not have to git status as you go through each state, but I personally find it helpful as well as satisfying to make sure that it went through.) If your file was staged, it should now say 'changes to be committed' with the same line under it again: 'modified: FILENAME'. We can now commit the change to finally being "saved" in the file itself. To do this, simply enter 'git commit FILENAME' (You can also simply enter a . one space after the git command, whether it be add or commit, and this will sub in the filename, if there's only one. Important to remember, if you do use the . instead of typing in a specific filename, git will add or commit ALL CHANGED FILES, so keep that in mind.) Now, you have made the commit to the changes you made in your file, and you can confirm this by opening the file and seeing if the changes are in it.

    <p> GitHub is literally a "Hub" for your gits. Seriously. What GitHub allows you to do, however, is save or store your git files to it, and if you permit them, lets anyone from anywhere at anytime open your git files and do what they want with them. This might sound kind of strange and intrusive at first thought, but think about it: You can work on an amazing coding project with any amount of people from anywhere in the world all from GitHub, and by simply sharing a stored git file. This is pretty awesome to me! And that is the sole and primary purpose of GitHub. Think of it as the Facebook of Coding.
