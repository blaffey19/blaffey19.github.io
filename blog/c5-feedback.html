  <h1>Tell Me How You Feel</h1>
  <h2>The Importance of Pairing and Feedback</h2>
  <h4>April 19th, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    Of all of the things that I am learning with DBC so far, I think I have to admit that perhaps pairing and understanding may be the most important and useful aspect of it, right up there with programming itself. I can honestly say that I take my feedback that I receive seriously, and I look at it as a grade from my pairing partner, and I often digest and implement advice and critiques given to me by partners. I think that it is extremely crucial to listen to what your project partner has to say, and communication and understanding plays a massive role in that. I mean think about it, no matter what you do in your life, you have to have good communication skills, and you have to understand what your coworker/spouse/classmate/etc. is trying to get across to you. All of this being said, I have hugely enjoyed pairing with people to work on and solve challenges at DBC. I am a social interactor that loves teamwork and getting someone else's perspective on a problem. It teaches me more than I could ever do by myself, staring at the screen researching in silence. I have been very lucky to pair with some genuine and great people so far, and I love getting to know people and how they process things. I don't know if I can pinpoint one particular challenge and say that it was fun and rewarding, only because I have found all of my pairing sessions to be both fun and rewarding-there is no bigger satisfaction, to me personally, then finally solving the problem and completing the challenge with a partner after hour(s) of research, work, and commitment to getting it done. So with that said, I enjoy and feel rewarded from every pairing challenge I do. That's not to say that some of them haven't been excrutiatingly difficult-most notably the validate credit card challenge from this week and the mandatory pairing challenge from week 4 were both very, very tough for my partner and I. Several times in each challenge we got stuck on something that ended up either being ludicrously simple to solve, like a missing . or (, or was so beyond our current knowledge and above our technical soundness that it took us tons and tons of research to resolve. I believe that in those moments though, is when you are really tested for your commitment and dedication, so I tackle them head on. I carefully read my feedback and try to understand the overall message or 'vibe' that my critic is trying to convey to me. I usually feel both excited and anxious to read the feedback, because I want to know how my partner thought I did. Sometimes the feedback can be more critical, other times it can be very complimentary and empowering to read. The feedback that I receive is usually always helpful to me, and typically I will learn or try to utilize at least one thing that was addressed in the feedback for my own studying and technique. An example is that after one session, I received feedback that I should really try to learn more keyboard shortcuts, and that it would really accelerate my operating. So, I learned as many shortcuts as I could after reading that feedback, and use them all the time now! I enjoy writing feedback, and I always try to never sound harsh or overly critical of a person. After all, we are all individuals, and our techniques, methods, and thought processes reflect this. Just because someone does something differently doesn't make it the wrong way to do it. It makes it there way to do it. So, I understand this, and I really just try to explain my feelings to the other person. I really do not enjoy being critical when I write feedback, but if I do think that there really is something the person can do to improve their technique, I explain it to them the best way I can. One session I had a very pushy and domineering partner, and in my feedback to them, I had explained that I felt suppressed and overwhelmed by their strong outgoing personality and wished that I could've had a little bit more to say when figuring out the problem. This wasn't mean or inconsiderate, it was just my honest feelings. All in all, feedback and pairing is an absolutely critical part of not just Dev Bootcamp, but in life itself.
