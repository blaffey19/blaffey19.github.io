      <h1> About </h1>
        <p> My name is Brendon Laffey, and I am from North Wildwood, Cape May County, New Jersey. I consider myself very fortunate to have grown up on a small resort-town island. </p>
        <p> One of the largest industries of Cape May County is real estate, and so, basically out of high school, I entered this competitive business as a realtor. I spent two years trying the best I could to learn the business, but my very young age combined with a lack of direction from a mentor or teacher made it very difficult for me to succeed in the business. By my 21st birthday, I had hit a wall, and lost interest in my young career as a realtor. I began to take an interest in web programming and development, and quickly fell in love with it. Weeks later, yes, just weeks after that, I applied to Dev Bootcamp. That is how devoted I am to learning this industry! And so, here I am, creating this website. </p>
